        <p><b>Treat yourself the best brunch in Brighton!</b>Definitely lives up to the reputation! All the dishes are PERFECT and can’t be plated in a better way. Everyone must add the hash brown! Loved the healthier twist to this egg benedict.</p>

        <p><b>Your impression towards vegan dishes will change overnight!</b>This is by far the best Buritto I’ve ever had in my life! You’ve just got to try it to believe it! Replacing meat with stir-fried tofu with some curry spices. It was hot and
          fresh! Just felt sorry for the chef, everyone seems to be ordering the same dish!</p>

        <img src="billiefood.jpg" alt="billies" width="150px">
        <p><b>Don't want to cook at home?</b>Huge portion; you can also prepare the same dishes at home; the hash brown was supposed to be their signature, but it was just average. The only thing I might come back for is the hot chocolate!</p>

        <p><b>Ever tried vegan pizzas?</b>Fresh from the oven, this is my FIRST vegan sourdough base pizza! It’s softer and chewier than the normal pizzas that you can get from other pizzerias.</p>

        <p><b>First Fish and Chips in the UK!</b>A great start, not sure which fish to choose, we randomly picked haddock. Hot, fresh and crispy! The fried halloumi is beyond description! It was soft and it melts in your mouth!</p>

        <p><b>Suddenly craving for some Japanese and don’t want to end up penniless?</b>Good portion; few vegetarian options (we’re picking 2 of the 3); If you’re lucky, the rice is cooked AL DANTE; Fresh and crispy croquette; Japanese curry is a
          alright, but still different from those in Japan! </p>
